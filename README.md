# Overview and Setup
This project was setup with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) as this was the recommended way suggested at the time for learning purposes. However as per the react docs the developer seem to have changed their mind and suggest using one of the react powered frameworks that are popular in the community, [Starting a New React Project](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project). A good alternative for CRA is a lightweight front end tooling framework [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). At this point in time I will not take the time to move this project to Vite as it was mainly created with practice and learning purposes in mind. There are some useful utilites and interesting implementations present within this repository often with references as comment that are providing additional insight on some of the topics, that might be useful as concepts, however there are also some poor implementations which might not be refactored.

# Preview
Preview of the project as visual gifs is currently under consideration. The project was not kept up to date, and has a lot of outdated dependancies, as such there is no intention of getting it hosted, but a showcase that is not dependant on keeping it up to date might be nice.
